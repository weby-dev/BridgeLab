        <strong>Important Note:</strong> Some websites may not allow embedding for security reasons. 
        Many sites use X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers to prevent their 
        content from being displayed in iframes. This is done to protect against clickjacking 
        attacks and maintain control over how their content is presented.
