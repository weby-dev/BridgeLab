                <mark>Consistency</mark> is one of the most important qualities that separate successful individuals
                from the rest.
                It’s not about doing something once and expecting results, but about repeating it until it becomes a
                habit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every great achievement starts with small, repeated actions.
                Whether it's building a business, mastering a skill, or improving health,
                progress comes from persistent effort over time.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “Success doesn’t come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                In a world where distractions are everywhere, maintaining focus is a superpower.
                The ability to show up daily, even when motivation fades, defines the line between dreamers and
                achievers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many people underestimate how small improvements compound.
                Doing something just 1% better every day might not seem like much,
                but over a year, it leads to massive transformation.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, whether you're learning to code, writing a book, or pursuing fitness goals,
                remember that <mark>discipline</mark> beats motivation, and consistency builds excellence.
