    <h2>Why Turn Off Autocomplete?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Security Benefits of autocomplete="off":</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Prevents Data Leakage:</strong> Disabling autocomplete prevents browsers 
            from storing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal 
            identification data that could be accessed by unauthorized users on shared computers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Protection Against Shoulder Surfing:</strong> When autocomplete is disabled, 
            previously entered data won't automatically appear in dropdown suggestions, reducing 
            the risk of sensitive information being visible to people nearby.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reduces Browser Vulnerability Risks:</strong> If a browser or system is 
            compromised, stored autocomplete data could be extracted. Disabling it minimizes 
            this attack surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong> Many security standards and regulations 
            (like PCI DSS for payment data) recommend or require disabling autocomplete for 
            sensitive fields to protect user privacy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Multi-User Environment Protection:</strong> On shared or public computers, 
            autocomplete data could expose previous users' sensitive information to subsequent users.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <em>Note: While autocomplete=off improves security, it should be combined with other 
        security measures like HTTPS, proper input validation, and secure password policies.</em>
