CSS Responsive Assignment Collection

This folder contains solutions for Assignment 9 (pure CSS, no external frameworks or JS). Each question is in its own folder `Q1-...` and contains an HTML and a CSS file.

To view a page locally:
- Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` from `/Users/dev/Others/JS` and open the URL shown in your browser.
- Example: `/assignmnet/CSS_Responsive/Q1-Responsive-Image-Filter-Gallery/Responsive-Image-Filter-Gallery.html`

To push to a new branch named `CSS-Responsive`:
- `git checkout -b CSS-Responsive`
- `git add assignmnet/CSS_Responsive`
- `git commit -m "Add CSS responsive assignment (Q1..Q10)"`
- `git push -u origin CSS-Responsive`

If you'd like, I can add an index page linking all questions.
